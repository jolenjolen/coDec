This is a test message. This message will be encrypted using the program. I am using 2 sts of alphabets in a list, the first which is in alphabetical order while the other liskt is scrambled and random. I would advise you to make changes to it so that it fits your encryption style. such as - if you want to encrypt 3 places forward in the alphabetical order, change the second list to start the letters from C and then moving on until the last character is B
